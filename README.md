# Prediction Markets

The contract is a Solidity smart contract for a decentralized prediction market. It enables users to create and trade prediction contracts on future events, and the outcome is settled automatically based on the event outcome. The contract stores information on each contractâ€™s creator, description, end time, price, and outcome, allowing for transparent trading without the need for intermediaries. Users can buy shares using cUSD tokens, and payouts are made to those who correctly predict the outcome. The contract is designed to be secure, using the Celo blockchain to enforce the rules of the market.
